       BIRD Internet Routing Daemon with built in Route Leak protection




This is a fork of BIRD Routing daemon (v1.5.0) with built in protection against
BGP route leaks.  Route leak is a network anomaly, when route learned from
provider or peer is announced to another provider or peer.  The effect of such
issues could vary from increased network delays for victim (originator of prefix)
to DoS for both victim and leaker.
This BGP implementation supports full compatibility with other BGP implementations
except the case where strict_mode is set by user.


Change in BGP Configuration:
In each BGP protocol section you must set a role option.  Currently, there
are 5 possible values for this option:
1) "provider" - sender is transit provider to neigbor;
2) "customer" - sender is customer of neigbor;
3) "peer" - sender and neighbor are peers;
4) "internal" - sender is part of an internal AS of an organsation which has multiple ASs;
5) "complex" - sender want to use per prefix role policies.
Without setting a role in BGP protocol section you will receive error message
from config parser.
Also you could set strict_mode option in BGP protocol section. In this scenario
BGP session with your neighbor will be established only if your neighbor also
support Roles and corresponding Role is correct.


BGP Logic modification:
BGP Local Preference attribute can transfer between two neighbors with internal
roles. BGP MED attribute don't reset on (internal, internal) link.
Finally, in Best Path Selection algorighm ebgp > ibgp condition is replaced by
external > internal roles.

How to install BIRD:


        ./configure
        make
        make install


Example of configuration with new options can be seen in doc/bird.conf.example
