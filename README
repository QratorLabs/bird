       BIRD Internet Routing Daemon with built in Route Leak protection




This is a fork of BIRD Routing daemon (v1.5.0) with built in protection against 
BGP route leaks.  Route leak is a network anomaly, when route learned from 
provider or peer is announced to another provider or peer.  The effect of such 
issues could vary from increased network delays for victim (originator of prefix) 
to DoS for both victim and leaker.
This BGP implementation supports full compatibility with other BGP implementations 
except the case where strict_mode is set by user.


BGP Protocol modification:
There are two main changes in BGP protocol behaviour:
1. BGP Update modification: to routes that were learned from upstreams or peers 
add special non-transitive attribute “Local Announce” (BGP Path attribute code 19).  
On links with upstreams and peers filter out routes with determined attribute; 
2. BGP Open modification: to OPEN messages add new capability option "Role" 
(Capability code 38), in which broadcast value of Role configuration option.  
Establish connection only if speaker and its neighbor have appropriate pair of 
Roles: (Provider, Customer), (Customer, Provider), (Peer, Peer), (Internal, Internal).


Change in BGP Configuration:
In each BGP protocol section you must set a role option.  Currently, there 
are 4 possible values for this option:
1) "provider" - neighbor is your upstream provider;
2) "customer" - neighbor is your customer;
3) "peer" - neighbor is your peer;
4) "internal" - neighbor is part of your AS or company (in case of multiple AS).
Without setting a role in BGP protocol section you will receive error message 
from config parser.
Also you could set strict_mode option in BGP protocol section.  In this scenario 
BGP session with your neighbor will be established only if your neighbor also 
support Roles and corresponding Role is correct.


How to install BIRD:


        ./configure
        make
        make install


Example of configuration with new options can be seen in /usr/local/etc/bird.conf.
