       BIRD Internet Routing Daemon with built in Route Leak protection




This is a fork of BIRD Routing daemon (v1.5.0) with built in protection against
BGP route leaks.  Route leak is a network anomaly, when route learned from
provider or peer is announced to another provider or peer.  The effect of such
issues could vary from increased network delays for victim (originator of prefix)
to DoS for both victim and leaker.
This BGP implementation supports full compatibility with other BGP implementations
except the case where strict_mode is set by user.


Change in BGP Configuration:
In each BGP protocol section you must set a role option.  Currently, there
are 4 possible values for this option:
1) "provider" - sender is transit provider to neigbor;
2) "customer" - sender is customer of neigbor;
3) "peer" - sender and neighbor are peers;
4) "internal" - sender is part of an internal AS of an organsation which has multiple ASs.
Without setting a role in BGP protocol section you will receive error message
from config parser.
Also you could set strict_mode option in BGP protocol section. In this scenario
BGP session with your neighbor will be established only if your neighbor also
support Roles and corresponding Role is correct.


BGP Protocol modification:
There are two main changes in BGP protocol behaviour:
1. BGP Update modification: to routes that were learned from upstreams or peers
add special transitive attribute “OTC” (Only to Customers) (BGP Path attribute code 19
in current realization).
On links with upstreams and peers filter out routes with determined attribute.
Also add this attribute to routes in customers and peers direction if neighbors
don't set their role and lower in priority routes, that already came with such an
attribute from peers or customers;
2. BGP Open modification: to OPEN messages add new capability option "Role"
(Capability code 38 in current realization), in which broadcast value of Role configuration option.
Establish connection only if speaker and its neighbor have appropriate pair of
Roles: (provider, customer), (customer, provider), (peer, peer), (internal, internal).


How to install BIRD:


        ./configure
        make
        make install


Example of configuration with new options can be seen in doc/bird.conf.example
