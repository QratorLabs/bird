       BIRD Internet Routing Daemon with built in Route Leak protection




This branch is an extension of master branch, that supports route leak detection
mechanism, which is described in draft-ymbk-idr-bgp-eotr-policy.


BGP Protocol modification:
For detection route leaks was added new transtive optional BGP PATH attribute 
eOTC (code 20 in this realization), which is following next set of rules:
 "a. If eOTC is not set and sender’s Role is Provider or Peer the eOTC
 attribute MUST be added with value equal to its ASN.
 b. If eOTC is not set and sender’s Role is Complex and prefix role
 is Provider or Peer the eOTC attribute MUST be added with value
 equal to its ASN.
 c. If eOTC is set, receiver’s Role is Provider or Peer, and its
 value is not equal to neighbor ASN then such incoming route is
 route leak and MUST be given a lower local preference, or they
 MAY be dropped.
 d. If eOTC is set, receiver’s is Complex and prefix role Role is
 Provider or Peer, and eOTC value is not equal to neighbor ASN
 then such incoming route is route leak and MUST be given a lower
 local preference, or they MAY be dropped."
